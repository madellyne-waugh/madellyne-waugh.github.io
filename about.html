	<p>Hi! My name is Maddie. I wear a lot of hats: I have degrees in mathematics and computer science from the College of William & Mary and the University of Virginia, but I'm also interested in just about everything from art to history to linguistics to literature.</p>

	<p>This website is meant to serve as a repository of all those different things, in the style of old-fashioned personal pages that are, in my opinion, some of the best things on the internet. Each of them is a monument to the human spirit of creativity and the radical possibility of the internet, something lost in the modern landscape of the same five algorithmic feeds to scroll. Make your own; it's easier than you think!</p>
